## plots
A collection of python plots used at the RLI. 

### Finding a plot
In this repository you can find a table listing all the existing plots and their specific characteristics. If you can't find exactly what you need, you might still be able to use a different plot as a template.

### Adding a plot
If you want to add a plot, first check the table and make sure it isn't a duplicate. An added plot should contain the following:
- python code
- visual representation
- table entry

Nice to have:
- example data
- RLI colors
- RLI font
- code documentation

### Requesting a plot
If you are looking for a specific plot, you can open an issue with your requirements. This lets people who have already made such a plot see the demand and encourages them to upload their work.
