## plots
A collection of python plots used at the RLI. 

### Finding a plot
In this repository you can find a table listing all the existing plots and their specific characteristics. If you can't find exactly what you need, you might still be able to use a different plot as a template.

### Adding a plot
If you want to add a plot, first check the table and make sure it isn't a duplicate. An added plot should contain the following:
- python code
- visual representation
- table entry

Nice to have:
- example data
- RLI colors
- RLI font
- code documentation

### Table
You can find a table with all the uploaded plot functionalities in our internal cloud service here

When adding code to the repository, please make sure to fill the table as far as possible. Bold column names should be the minimal requirments

**Name**: A short name defining the plot functionality							
**Description**: A comprehensive description for what this code snippet can be used for							
**Plot Type**: Plot Type description. If is an auxillary function used in plottling like data-handling, plot positioning, plor formating use "None"					
**Code Snippet**: Link to the code in this repository							
Corporate Design: Does this feature make use of at least some corporate design rules, e.g color, font, logos etc.							
**Library**: Which underlying plot library is used							
Animated: Does your Plot use animiation							
Interactive: Is your plot interactive							
Minimal code example: Is the code prepared in a simple way, that input data and attribute adjustment is clear?							
Last Update: When was the code last update or uploaded first							
Example Output: Is a picture, markdown file other form of output attached, where an examplary plot output is visable							
**ID**: An Id for this plot function, which should be the suffix of the filename or commented in the top of the code, to have a unique connection between this table and code snippets							



### Requesting a plot
If you are looking for a specific plot, you can open an issue with your requirements. This lets people who have already made such a plot see the demand and encourages them to upload their work.
