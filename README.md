## plots
A collection of python plots used at the RLI. 

### Finding a plot
In this repository you can find a table listing all the existing plots and their specific characteristics. If you can't find exactly what you need, you might still be able to use a different plot as a template.

### Adding a plot
If you want to add a plot, first check the table and make sure it isn't a duplicate. An added plot should contain the following:
- python code
- visual representation
- table entry

Nice to have:
- example data
- RLI colors
- RLI font
- code documentation

### Table
You can find a table with all the uploaded plot functionalities in our internal cloud service here <br>
[Link to Wolke](https://wolke.rl-institut.de/s/8PPCwcD8ddWdnXj).

When adding code to the repository, please make sure to fill the table as far as possible. Bold column names should be the minimal requirements.<br>
- **Name**: A short name defining the plot functionality. <br>  						
- **Description**: A comprehensive description for what this code snippet can be used for.   <br>  					
- **Plot Type**: Plot type description like "scatter", "line" or "pie chart". If it is an auxillary function used in plottling like data-handling, plot positioning, plot formating use "None". <br>  		
- **Code Snippet**: Link to the code in this repository.<br>  	  						
- Corporate Design: Does this feature make use of at least some corporate design rules, e.g color, font, logos etc.<br>  	  						
- **Library**: Which underlying plot library is used. <br>  	 						
- Animated: Does your plot use animation.<br>							
- Interactive: Is your plot interactive.	<br>						
- Minimal code example: Is the code prepared in a simple way, that input data and attribute adjustment is clear?<br>							
- Last Update: When was the code last updated or uploaded first.<br>							
- Example Output: Is a picture, markdown file other form of output attached, where an examplary plot output is visable<br>							
- **ID**: An Id for this plot function, which should be the suffix of the filename or commented in the top of the code, to have a unique connection between this table and code snippets.<br>						



### Requesting a plot
If you are looking for a specific plot, you can open an issue with your requirements. This lets people who have already made such a plot see the demand and encourages them to upload their work.
